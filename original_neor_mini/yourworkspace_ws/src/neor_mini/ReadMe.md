1、The display.launch  file will launch the neor mini urdf file that added sensors link on neor, visual on Rviz.
2、The gazebo.launch file is to visualize the urdf file with the sensor simulation plug-in added in gazebo and rviz 

Note: Since the urdf file loaded in rviz cannot have Chinese, in the gazebo.launch file: the urdf model file loaded by rviz and gazebo is different. Those who are interested can view the difference between these two urdf files.
